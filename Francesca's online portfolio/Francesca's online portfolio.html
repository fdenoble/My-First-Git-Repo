<p>Hello! My name is Francesca, and welcome to my online portfolio where I'll be sharing vaguely incorrect information about myself to avoid oversharing on the internet. <br>
<br>
I was born on January 1, 1999. Wow, what a day. Take me back. I studied English Language and Literature at the University of Western Ontario from 2017 to 2021, and now here I am, trying to code. <br>
<br>
Below is an exhaustive list of all of the projects I've worked on throughout my years: <br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://westernu.alumni-perks.com" target="_blank">Western Alumni Perks</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.canadalife.com" target="_blank">Canada Life</a>
</ul>
Okay, perhaps neither of those is completely true. 
<br>
<br>
I currenly work for Canada Life as a Senior Marketing Specialist in Business Marketing. This means I try to tell you <i>why</i> our products are <i>important</i>, and not just <i>why</i> you should buy them. That's Product Marketing.
<br>
<br>
With great fluency, I currently speak: <br>
<ul>
  <li>English</li>
  <li>Italian</li>
  <li>French</li>
  <li>Faroese</li>
  <li>Swahili</li>
</ul>
I'm telling the truth, of course. <br>
<br>
From what I can recall, these are the last couple of courses I took during my time at Western: <br>
<ol>
  <li>Tech: Web Development</li>
  <li>English: Paradise Lost</li>
  <li>SASAH: Capstone Project</li>
  <li>English and Art: The Pre-Raphaelites</li>
  <li>Italian: Advanced</li>
  <li>And approximately 18 others</li>
</ol>
In terms of activities, I actually pay to beat people up and get beat up on a daily basis. It takes up about 50% of my time. We call this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu" target="_blank">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.</a>
<br>
